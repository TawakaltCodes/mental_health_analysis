### Effect of Mental Health on Students' Performance

I participated in a Hackathon involving the analysis of large dataset. At the end of the competition, my project ranked amongst the top three(3) of over 100 students. In this project, I analyzed the effects mental health status has on students' performance, building a refined dashboard on PowerBI to convey my findings. Attached in the main files, are a sceenshot of my dashboard, as well as the PowerBI workbook. Feel free to make use of the filter and drill down buttons for clearer analysis.
